# British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience

This repository contains my work from the **British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience** hosted on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/british-airways/data-science-yqoz).  
The project focuses on applying data science techniques to real-world airline business challenges, including demand forecasting and customer behavior analysis.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

During the simulation, I worked with real-world airline data to:

✈️ **Build a Lounge Eligibility Lookup Table**  
- Performed tier-wise passenger analysis across key flight groupings.  
- Forecasted lounge demand to optimize planning and resource allocation.

📈 **Develop a Predictive Model**  
- Analyzed booking data to identify key factors influencing customer purchasing behavior.  
- Built and evaluated a machine learning model to forecast booking trends.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📝 Tasks Overview

### **Task 1 — Lounge Eligibility Lookup**
- Analyzed **tier-wise passenger data** from the summer schedule.
- Built a **lounge eligibility lookup table** to forecast demand and optimize lounge planning.
- Delivered findings in a report (`Lounge Eligibility Lookup and Justification.pdf`).

### **Task 2 — Customer Booking Predictive Model**
- Cleaned and explored customer booking data (`customer_booking.csv`).
- Built a **predictive model** to identify key factors influencing booking behavior.
- Visualized feature importance (`feature_importance.png`).
- Summarized results in a presentation (`Customer booking predictive model.ppt`).
